# Thank you for downloading this application

i'm [Tony Mushah](#tony-mushah-links) the developper behind this app

Sorry for not giving updates during these 3 months, but now the `0.1.5` is now out.

I made a lot of testing and features, some are cool, (un)stable,... 

Anyway, it's for you to discover all of these new features, 
Because i forgot most of them during these 3 months.

Now the changelog : 

__Note : i mostly forgot them. If you can make a comparaison, please make it in the [Github Discussion](https://github.com/tonymushah/special-eureka/discussions)__

## For Mangadex : 

### Added : 

- Right to Left and Left to Right sidebar in User Sidebar Option (you can do it with <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>R</Kbd> but this will also reload the app window in Windows)

- Simple search for authors/artistists by name
- Simple search for Groups by name
- Right click menu for chapter and manga componnents (except Manga Popular Element on the Home page and the Popular Manga Page)

- An herta easter egg... (Push : <Kbd>Ctrl</Kbd> + <Kbd>H</Kbd> on any Mangadex Page for some __kuru__)
